- This talk is a general talk about server - database interactions
- I am using NoSQL, but all of the examples also apply to SQL. So no joins
- I'm using Nodejs as a runtime, the implementation of the code does not matter.

- In all of the examples, I will show a bad or common method, talk about it, and then a better method

- Atomic:
  - Bad implementation
  - Bad code
  - Call good code
  - Show badness
  - Solution is atomicism
  - Show goodness, no atomicism
  - Works
  - Ask questions
  - Answer & show pic

- Sort
  - It depends on your architecture
  - Sort on datbase if you can, especially with node
  - Bad algorithm
  - Bad code
  - Depends on architecture, node is single threaded, and it blocks
  - Good algorithm
  - Good code
  - Ask questions


- Aggregate
  - Similar to sorting, depends
  - This is for advanced sorting, flexible sorting
  - Bad algorithm
  - Bad code
  - Very flexible sorting on db is so useful
  - Questions/ statements
